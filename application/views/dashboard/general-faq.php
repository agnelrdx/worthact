                                    The acronym SOS has many abbreviations; 'Save our Succor', 'Save our Souls', Save our Ship' and so on. The original use however, dates back to 1908 as an International Morse Code distress signal. We in WorthAct chose to give it the meaning, 'Save our Souls', as we believe that everyone and everything including our earth has a soul that cries out for help from the present stressfully polluted condition. Considering our daily busy life it is easy not to hear this cry for help. However, if you could stop for a moment, you might hear it.
