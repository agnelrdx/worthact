                                <p>This could be due to one of the reasons mentioned below. Payment is under process or verification by Paypal. In this case you will get payment status as pending. Once the payment is confirmed you will be updated as premium member. In case Paypal rejects the transaction, the amount will be credited back to your account within 7 working days. You accidently closed the payment page without returning to the merchant site.  In this case our system will not be able to get the transaction details from Paypal instantly. So forward the proof of debited money from your bank account to Paypal, to getintouch@worthact.com so that we can upgrade instantly to the premium membership.</p>
