<h2 class="text-center">Afforestation</h2>
<p>We have had in a bountiful supply, thick forests and plantations that has helped us maintain our world since the time of beginning. It is the cosmic law to give and take. If the balance is not maintained things can go wrong in many levels.</p>
<p>We humans have only created as much as to emit carbon dioxides and chemicals to the atmosphere; but not to revert this process. This is where the forests and the plants play their role. Forests helps in absorbing the carbon dioxide and give out oxygen for the rest of species of living beings.</p>
<p>Forests are cleared at an alarming rate on meeting the demand of global communities. Agriculture, urbanization, mining and forest fires are some of the main reasons why we face an environmental crisis as forests and trees form the backbone in holding all the other ecology factors together.</p>
<p>Trees and forests not only purifies the air we breathe but also provide sufficient shade that cools the earth, regulating regional temperature.</p>
<p>Forests are can be compared to sponges that absorb pollutants. Purifying air is what we all are aware about, but trees that are thrive along river banks and areas that receive heavy rainfall, can block chemicals or wastes with its roots much similar to preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>The very exposure to forests can boost creativity, speed up recovery of some diseases, encourage meditation, mindfulness and even helps us live longer.</p>
<p>Last but not least the natural beauty which is an obvious benefit convinces us to appreciate and preserve forests for generations to come.</p>
<p>So as you can see, it is impossible for humans to survive without forests and greenery, however it is up to us to make sure we never have to try.</p>
<p>A chain of events can take place locally and around the world by degradation of forests that are complex ecosystems which will affect almost every species on the planet. In order to restore ecological balance of all ecosystems, natural plantation or artificial seeding process to restructure the forest cover is the only remedy; Afforestation- even though it is not a binding solution for the damage caused by the never ending emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere â€“ courtesy humans..!!</p>
