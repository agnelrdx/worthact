<h2 class="text-center">Animal Care</h2>
<p>Most humans have a dominating character over our fellow beings the animals, just because they cannot express themselves or communicate their preferences and grievances effectively.  But the real question is "can they suffer ?"</p>
<p>It's a difficult topic to discuss about as everyone wants these animals to be protected but with different reasons. About 60% of people are concerned about animals just to satisfy their food requirements in the form of meat, which is one major factor for miserable conditions faced by animals. There are thinkers who believe that humans are distinctively different from other non- human animals. We fail to realize that we are also part of the ecology and by the gifts we have for communication and expression we have taken advantage of the environment. World belongs to all living beings, not just humans, and in fact we humans need the environment consisting of these animals to survive whereas animals and environment do not necessarily need humans for their existence.</p>
<p>Animal kingdom is majestic and it has a beauty to keep environment in balance. However with the increase in use of meat and increased competition in food industry even common animal species are in danger.</p>
<p>Foie Gras is a famous luxury food product made from the liver of duck or goose that is forcefully fattened; by filling it's stomach through a tube almost suffocating it to death.</p>
<p>Broiler chickens that are bred to have larger quantity of meat die with stress and increased weight even before they reach the slaughterhouses. We can breed and create more but the greed of humans causes so much waste of energy and sources.</p>
<p>This is how the food industry is growing, inconsiderate of the wellbeing of the animals. But it is not too late for some to realize this and take actions to give animals a set of rights which unveils the fact that they are not much different from human beings.</p>
<p>We cannot for sure turn each and every one into a vegetarian or vegan but at least shall we make sure that the meat we eat came from an animal that was treated and respected enough when it was alive with welfare? This consideration in each of us can bring a whole lot of change in the animal ecology.</p>
<p>Both wild and domestic animals need protection and also wellbeing. A group of professionals including veterinarians and organizations including World Organisation for Animal Health has adopted a set of rules after an excruciating crisis in animal welfare.</p>
<p>The Five Freedoms are:</p>
<p><strong>Freedom from thirst and hunger–</strong> by ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigour.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom from discomfort–</strong> by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area</p>
<p><strong>Freedom from pain, injury, and disease–</strong> by prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment</p>
<p><strong>Freedom to express most normal behaviour–</strong> by providing sufficient space, proper facilities, and company of the animal's own kind</p>
<p><strong>Freedom from fear and distress–</strong> by ensuring conditions and treatment without mental suffering and physical agony.</p>
<p>Another problem faced by even developed countries are the presence of stray animals, specifically stray dogs, which have no choice but to survive the streets without getting themselves harmed. Solutions are reached all over, to kill these animals, but how would that make us human?</p>
<p>Increase in human population, adopting pets for the wrong reason, abandoning of pets and improper garbage disposal are some of the main reasons for stray animals to multiply in bounds and leaps.</p>
<p>We are all part of mother earth, and are only here to share and grow what is given to us from nature. But excessive greed and a speedy lifestyle has made mankind blind enough to turn us into insensible animals slaughtering whatever that stands on our way. Take a break, rethink what the actual problem is and lets spread harmony among fellow beings. We need you to help us spread this to one and all.</p>

    <p>Human beings are only a part of the animal family on Earth that we call as our home. Being capable to empathize love, care and compassion, isn’t it the responsibility of every human being to protect that family?</p>
