<h2 class="text-center">Eco friendly Homes</h2>
<p>Concrete is the most widely used building material today as a result of its strength and its durability. It is used in homes, airports, skyscrapers, tunnels and pretty much every other type of construction you can think of. Cement is an ingredient that makes up concrete, along with water, sand and gravel. Cement acts as a hydraulic binding material, hardening with water and tying together all the aggregate materials.</p>
<p>After coal-powered electricity, cement manufacture is the next biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. Concrete causes damage to the most fertile layer of the earth- the topsoil, and it is used to create hard surfaces which contribute to surface runoff causing soil erosion, water erosion, water pollution and flooding.</p>
<p>Concrete dust released by building demolition and natural disasters can be a major source of dangerous air pollution.  Concrete recycling and better practices are increasing in response to improved environmental awareness, legislation, and economic considerations in developed world, but how about developing nations without awareness, strong legislations etc.? The impact is unfathomable.</p>

Itâ€™s high time for the humanity to adopt the technologies used by our forefathers in constructions and their way of living.</p>
<p>The first step should be about acting immediately to bring the change in how we live our lives depending on the natural resources and using materials and methods that cause minimal damage to the environment, followed by responsible use of unavoidable facilities such as houses, vehicles and survival items to lessen that imprint to the best of your ability.</p>
<p>The final step we can take is to spread the message and connect with eco-friendly communities and organizations to create a network and lead a sustainable life. It's a way of living, change of perspective. Worthact platform would be a part of this change to make our earth last a little more long for many more generations to come.</p>
