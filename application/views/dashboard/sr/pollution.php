<h2>Prevention of Pollution</h2>

<p>We live in a world with factories pumping out heavy chemicals and pollutants into the atmosphere and water bodies creating a mass crisis on hygienic and healthy environment. It has become very difficult to stand against these pollution creators as they also pave way to supplement our necessary life styles. A life without an automobile is almost impossible to imagine nowadays. Burning of fossil fuels, use of plastic, electricity and water usage beyond the limits have become basic necessities.</p>
<p>There are various strategies for pollution control that helps to manage pollutants or wastes after it is being emitted and reduce its impact on environment. But, a pollution prevention strategy can Increase the efficiency of process by which the amount of pollution gets reduced right at the sources.</p>
<p>Pollution is mainly categorized into three areas:</p>
<p><strong>Air pollution</strong> begins when toxics are released into atmosphere through vehicles, cooking, burning of wood or fossil fuels, which can cause extreme situations such as global warming and acid rain.</p>
<p><strong>Water pollution</strong> has become one of the most prominent and dangerous form of pollution. Dumping of wastes from factories, nuclear wastes, oil spills, pesticides or insecticides that run down to the ground water and finally Eutrophication; daily usage of water bodies by humans.</p>
<p><strong>Water pollution</strong> not only affects the aquatic animals but the whole food chain.</p>
<p><strong>Soil pollution</strong> happens due to combination of chemicals from human activities and industries. These chemicals make the soil incapable of growing plants that can hold it together causing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Apart from these there are noise pollution, light pollution, thermal pollution, radioactive pollutions and so on.</p>
<p>With the increase in population, pollution has become a great concern. Pollution from human activities are inevitable . With well planned prevention programmes pollution can be reduced, reused, or prevented. Reducing and managing pollution may decrease the number of deaths and illnesses from pollution-related diseases.</p>
<p>With nearly seven billion people in the world, the fact that an average person produces 4.4 pounds of waste every day it is clear to see why pollution is a huge problem.</p>
<p>In developing countries we see the governments failing to advice the citizens about the crisis and it's future mass effect. A major prevention can be obtained in this scale of pollution by a controlled population growth. There are numerous methods and possibilities to make a drastic change in pollution rise, but the fast growing population and high capital requirement are the challenges faced for implementation of these scientific methods.</p>
<p>Its never too late, a small stone may seem like nothing but the ripple effect can bring a huge change in lives.</p>
