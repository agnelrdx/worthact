<h2 class="text-center">Waste Management</h2>
<p>We all have heard about the three R's, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. How many of us actually do it?</p>
<p>The ongoing global economic growth and development cannot be sustained with the current production and consumption patterns. We consume more from our natural resources than that the planet can replenish. The growth of civilization and lifestyle with the development of products and new inventions every other day, urbanization looks really bright and advanced. At the same time we leave behind a huge pile of responsibilities. Preserving, protecting and managing the resources are one, but more importantly the wastes that is left over from the manufacture and use of these products make things even worse if not taken care of. </p>
<p>Wastes, if not managed can cause atmospheric, environmental, health, natural resources damages and can even bring down the whole economy. Modus operandi of public waste disposal may differ from country to country as per their commitment to the environment but generally, in developing nations certain guidelines have to be maintained in order to make the world a better place to live in. Let's consider a scenario where an old building has to be demolished. It will surely be a good sight to see the building crumbling down, but have you ever thought about the effect the components used to hold that building together may cause if it gets mixed with the Earth's environment? Chemicals from the cement and other harmful substances can disintegrate the quality of the soil, which in future will no longer be fruitful. In developed countries there are certain rules and regulations that must be taken into procedure for such operations, however in developing countries they lack these regulations and guidelines to a large extent. </p>
<p>Another matter that has to be taken into consideration is trucks emptying garbage cans the street corners and less-populated areas. Have you ever considered where they take these wastes and what they do with it? Well, before we answer that there is an important matter to be discussed. Institutions and companies start waste management operations with the sole motive of profit making, but what if plastic wastes are burned? Can we consider that as proper waste management? It's not only about plastic wastes, even in a small town we can  come across toxic wastes that are much harmful and should be managed in a specific manner to avoid damages at any stage. If these are not taken into serious consideration, and without globally implemented guidelines, sustainability of future generations will be next to impossible. </p>
<p>We are here to help you to be much more efficient in observing and identifying daily waste produces and how we can take actions to manage it effectively.</p>
<p>Of course prevention is better than cure, but we have our daily needs and requirements that we are so much used to that we cannot avoid them.  So let us start with the 3 R's: There are countries that pay for waste materials from their neighboring countries and they have become very much efficient in waste management, that they are making an economy grow with it by reusing, recycling and converting these into energy! Yes energy! Vital resource for human survival, we are lost without internet nowadays aren't we? Think if a day comes where there would be no more electricity.</p>
<p>Energy cannot be created, it can be only transformed from one form to another. But this is on a larger scale, and we must be aware about it. Nothing can be obtained in one big step, it's always the small steps that guide us to the bigger ones.</p>
<p>Let's start from the basics and clean up our mess.</p>
<p>By cleaning up or managing these wastes we may not solve global environmental problems but we sure can gain :</p>
<p><strong>Economical and social:</strong> reuse and recycle not only reduces the use of resources but also creates possibilities for new jobs and business opportunities building up the society from poverty. </p>
<p><strong>Environmental:</strong>  Eliminating impacts on environment through reducing, recycling and reusing, we also improve in resource extraction causing for improved air and water quality.  </p>
<p>Above all, are we not living for ourselves, our fellow beings and for our little ones that are the coming generations? Let us think of it in this way and provide them a healthy environment and more robust economy with a cleaner lifestyle, shall we?</p>
<p>Interested worth actors in Waste Management are requested to take the next step by exploring the opportunities and possibilities to do a worthy act of your own. Invite likeminded parties and form groups to bring a positive change in your preferred localities. Write blogs, Share your thoughts, actions, experiences, contributions and ideas for better Waste Management in your society.</p>
<p>Associations, organizations and solution providers who work for proper waste management and clean up may please post their innovations, expertize and functions for others to keep our planet clean and safe.</p>
