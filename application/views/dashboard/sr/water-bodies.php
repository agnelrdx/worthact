<h2 class="text-center">Preservation of Water bodies</h2>
<p>70 percent of earth is covered with water, but hardly 2 percent is accessible and drinkable.</p>
<p>It was taught to all of us as a child how to conserve water; come to think of it, water is consumed for almost every human processes and activities. Water is an important factor for both domestic and industrial purposes, which undeniably makes it the greatest resource available.</p>
<p>However, taking a closer look of this resource we get a shocking revelation; ranging from floating plastics to nuclear chemicals, we have turned these water bodies to a pool of poison. Such abuse of freshwater bodies are what we know as water pollution.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial wastes</strong> cover a huge portion of the graph that cause water pollution. Factories that fail to dispose of left overs or waste materials from their production units responsibly, end up dumping them in water bodies.</p>
<p><strong>Agricultural wastes</strong> may not sound right but, chemicals that assist in plant growth may not be good for animals or human beings. With rain washing it down to the water bodies, can cause serious effect to the ones who consume from it.</p>
<p><strong>Marine dumping</strong> and sewage wastes are other major damaging activities we cause with ignorance. It is almost like we do not even care where the water we use and drink comes from. Considering economic benefits and easiness of disposing we tend to close our eyes and believe everything is fine.</p>
<p><strong>Urban development</strong> and use of fossil fuels create air pollution which causes chemicals and poisons in the air to rise up to the atmosphere and wash it back down in the form of rain. This can cause two damages; these rain drops that carry chemicals gets mixed with fresh water bodies and pollute what is left and rain water harvesting can do a reverse effect than help.</p>
<p><strong>Radioactive waste</strong> doesn't take much in the graph quantity wise, however these are the deadliest ones. Humans are not perfect and so are our activities. We have already learned it through the disaster that happened with Japan's and Russia's nuclear plant accidents polluting the nearby oceans and other fresh water resources.</p>
<p><strong>Global warming</strong>, some may say itâ€™s a myth but then, where are the Ice formations and why are the water levels rising?  The melting of ice is due to the increase in temperature of atmosphere as a result of carbon emissions and use of harmful products,that can cause aquatic animals to die, thus making the water polluted organically.</p>
<p>A case study shows that more damages are caused from developing countries than from the developed countries due to lack of fiscal support and awareness, sanitary facilities and waste management systems and so on.</p>
<p>The water we drink today has been around in one form or the other since the beginning and with a high rise in population there is a steep drop in ratio for clean supply of water for human use as the quantity of water remains fairly constant.</p>
<p>Water is essential for producing everything we see around us from food we eat to computers we use in our offices and also in keeping the environment healthy. However humans are extremely poor in giving back to nature in comparison to what we take from her. </p>
<p>In the coming future not so far away it is said around 2 billion people will face drought and about two-third of the world will live with water stress as a result of abuse of water resources. </p>
<p>So with all this it is clear that we cannot generate or create more quantity of water; but the only option is to manage what is remaining.</p>
<p>It is a critical stage with the population rising at a high rate but resources remaining the same, or worse, being misused, each one of us have to do our role in protecting the resources and lead by example.</p>
<p>Interested worth actors to preserve water bodies are requested to take the next step by exploring the opportunities and possibilities to do a worthy act of your own. Invite like-minded parties and form groups to bring a positive change in your preferred locality. Write blogs, Share your thoughts, actions, experiences, contributions and ideas for preservation of rivers, lakes or ponds in respected localities.</p>
<p>Associations, organizations, solution providers who work for preservation of fresh water resources and clean up may please post their innovations, expertize and functions for others to maintain abundance of water in our planet.</p>

    <p>Natural water bodies are life lines of this planet. In certain regions, uncivilized population growth and their greed, either causes extinction or severely pollutes the water bodies. Deforestation, mountain quarrying, sand quarrying, dumping of toxic wastes, encroachment of banks, gradual filling, converting water bodies to lands, so on goes human activities, digging our own graves.</p>
