<h2 class="text-center">Women empowerment & Child Welfare</h2>
<p>Women always have had an important role in our society. They have achieved many milestones in our society proving they are capable just as much or more than a man. However even in this twenty first century there are groups of people who think that men are superior to women and along with gender discrimination, negligence and cultural norms, women are facing a high deal of hardship in the society. </p>
<p>How would you feel if you are treated different from others and denied equality among peers? Even after the implementation of women empowerment act and rules for gender equality, discrimination prevails in many social circles and societies. Women are still looked down upon. </p>
<h4>Domestic violence</h4>
<p>A large percentage of women worldwide experience physical or sexual violence committed from their relationship partner. </p>
<h4>Sexual Trafficking</h4>
<p>Sexual exploitation is the fastest growing criminal enterprise in the world. Women and girls make up almost 90% of the victims.</p>
<h4>Education</h4>
<p>Even in many developing countries education has become a mandatory right for every individual. There can be many reasons to get on the way to access education, however being a girl could not be one of them in some communities around the world.</p>
<h4>Child marriage and pregnancy </h4>
<p>Denying the right to good health, education and nutrition there are still a huge population of girls being prepared to be brides and be bred. This causes depression, lack of nutrition and education. This is also one of the main reason for occurrence of deaths during child birth.</p>
<p>Empowering women in developing countries can increase the economic growth and reduce the poverty level since women represent a higher percentage of the world's neglected, poor population. </p>
<p>World organizations and national governments have ruled rights for women, but only with support from society we can bring equality and put an end to this discrimination; ensuring basic human rights, educational rights and reproductive rights. </p>
<p>Similar are the situations faced by children in our society. They are our future and what they see, hear and learn at a very young age can affect their mental health which gets reflected on their activities and developments for an entire life time.</p>
<h4>Poverty, Illiteracy and child labour</h4>
<p>Under-developed countries and developing countries face many challenges in dispersing and distributing benefits and facilities across the whole nation, forcing families to send their children for menial tasks, causing a barrier between them and education.</p>
<h4>Indoctrination</h4>
<p>A topic not many are bold enough to talk about â€“ training and teaching children from a very tender age to be community specific and forcing them to fight for such beliefs.</p>
<p>Child welfare is not only concerned about abuse and mistreatment of children but also of children who live with their families that are not capable to provide standard facilities. </p>
<p>Improper family planning can be one of the reasons for children to suffer. It is us as a society that should provide a helping hand and give hopes to these kids, making sure they lead a better life.</p>
<p>Above all these treating them as one of us is vital to create a healthy mentality and create a healthy generation for a better world tomorrow. </p>

    <p>Women in most societies are underprivileged due to severe discrimination, violence, polygamy, sexual advances etc. Women should have equal rights as men and should be respected more as they are the better half in our planet.</p>
    <p>Children are our future generation. The quality of future society depends on how well we educate and form them. However, in many societies, children are exploited and denied their rightful childhood.</p>
