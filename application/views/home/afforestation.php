                Have you ever tried imagining how our earth would be, if there were no more trees? Exactly! There would be nothing left to imagine, not only because there would not be any more production of papers or wooden products, but because they serve a vital role in the carbon cycle.
                <br/>With the rapid rise in population, along with the use of land and wood as luxury, the future is near -  a world that is dry, lifeless with raging wars for natural resources.  Trees are a crucial factor for the existence of our world; apart from providing oxygen to sustain our lives, trees also prevent pollution and erosion of soil which breaks the banks of rivers and other water bodies when a flood hits the area. These cause the rivers to create new paths and more soil erosions, contributing to droughts.
                <br/>So why do we have to afforest? <br/>Register with us to unveil more on the topic and the possibilities you have to make a change.
