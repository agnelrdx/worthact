                <h2>Aim</h2>
                <p>Worthact is an Online Global Platform addressing Social and Environmental needs of our Planet mainly by creating awareness and encouraging worthy actions.</p>
                <p>We invite members as Individuals, Organisations and Companies from all over the World to be a part of this venture. Needy individuals and Organisations can find assistance, help and advice from other individuals, experts and companies around the Globe by just posting an SOS in site.</p>
                <p>Companies can join and find areas where they are able to carry out their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities...all from the 10 initiatives listed in the landing page. Supporting facilities include free Job Portal, Chat, BlogSpot and a Social Media page where ideas and projects can be shared. Companies and Individuals can also post their achievements, worthy actions and other relevant activities under the SOS tab which serves as awareness and inspiration to other like-minded persons and Organisations.</p>
                <p>In short, we aim to make each person carry out their Individual Social Responsibilities, and companies spice up their CSR activities by making them plant trees, donate organs, sponsor children and many other similar activities.</p>
                <p>In the near future, Projects like sponsoring villages, planting mangrove forests and women and child empowerment programs will be undertaken and implemented. Company registrations, member participations and building relevant databases are currently being carried out tirelessly as we are still on our first steps....</p>
