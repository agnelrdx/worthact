                Animals have always played an important role in the lives of humanity since a very long time. The connection between animals and humans is one of the most fundamental bonds that can ever be experienced. 
                <br/>One of the reasons that makes this bond special, is that it provides the world's population with a well-nourished and healthy diet through a sustainable supply of poultry and dairy products. Another important aspect is the companionship provided by pets which can cure depressions and even other mental distresses. 
                <br/>To improve the ecology along with the economy, through strict regulations on cruelty and unfair treatments of animals, both wild and domestic, register and indulge yourself to fight for Animal welfare.
