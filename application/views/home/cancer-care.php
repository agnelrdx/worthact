                Prevention is better than cure. However, in life many things happen unexpectedly, especially health issues. But with timely consulting and healthy lifestyle, majority of them can be avoided or at least regulated. 
                <br/>Our body fights unwanted viruses and bacteria’s regularly, making us feel healthy and normal, but there are cells that fight and protect us from infections without even creating any reactions for us to feel. Such battles cannot always be won by our body, and that is when we depend on medicines. 
                Cancer on other hand, is caused by uncontrolled division of cells making it almost impossible for our body or medicines to cure. Hence it is vital we learn the methods and practices to prevent or regulate this in-despicable disease and to be there for support to those who couldn’t prevent it through Cancer Care; register with us to know more on how to take things into your hands, spread awareness and support others.
