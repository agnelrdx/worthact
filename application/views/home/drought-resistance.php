                Water is the second among fundamental natural resources that should be preserved after oxygen or clean air. The after effects of deforestation and improper irrigation can cause water bodies to lose their banks, thus creating new paths which lead to drought. 
                <br/>With much simpler thoughts; life is sustained through food we eat which we obtain through agriculture that is dependent mainly on water supply. If drought keeps occurring and no preventive or resistance measures are taken, what are we going to live on? Drought resistance methods and practices can help us preserve our environment, and keep our future free from thirst and unwanted diseases.
