                Dwellings use up an enormous amount of energy, especially for heating and lighting. Materials used such as concrete and tiles can create wastes that make the air, water and earth polluted and incapable of sustaining life. 
                <br/>We build houses for our privacy, to protect ourselves from exposure to varying climatic conditions and different types of pollutions. And if these buildings become the very reason for such pollutions, we sure are not doing something right. Eco friendly houses can be beneficial and non- harmful to environment and at the same time be resource-efficient too. Efficient use of renewable materials, the energy required to build it, and energy generated while living in it are the factors to be considered while constructing an Eco friendly home. Join us, to spread the message for a better tomorrow.
