                There is nothing noble than saving another life. A consent to allow healthy transplantable organs and tissues to be donated to the needy after death, or while the donor is alive, depending on the circumstances. Common transplant includes; heart, liver, pancreas, intestines, lungs, bones, bone marrow, skin and kidney. 
                <br/>Donating organs from one body can save up to 50 lives. The need for organ donors has never been greater and each year thousands meet their end, for want of organ transplant facilities. You can save lives and make a big difference by donating organs respecting the local laws applicable. Register with us for this noble cause.
