Collecting, transporting, processing, recycling and monitoring of waste materials constitutes the general process of waste management. Human activities can create wastes that pollute the environment and the process of waste management can help regulate the adverse effects these materials can cause to health and environment. Waste management can also be used to reuse resources.
