                Many a drop make an ocean, we all are familiar with this proverb. Similarly every bit of help counts. Water is the second most fundamental resource that is in grave danger and even the smallest help you do, can bring a change. Bringing a drastic change in our lifestyle will favorably alter availability and quality of our water resources. 
                <br/>We depend on water to sustain our lives, hence it is important to be responsible to find ways to conserve it. With only about three percentage of potable water for all the people on Earth, it only makes sense that we preserve water and make it our personal responsibility to do it rather than leaving it to others.
