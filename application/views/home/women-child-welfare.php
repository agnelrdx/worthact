            <p>
                Women and children are pushed backstage in most of the societies, considering them to be weak and incapable. But facts have now revealed how the benefits and growths achieved economically have taken over, by the indulgence of women in sectors that were taken care by men alone. 
                <br/>Children on the other hand, due to many reasons are limited to small achievements, and are not provided with enough facilities to perform to their potentials. To make things worse in some of the third world countries child labor still exists. 
                <br/>Laws are established to provide equity to all, however, there are still individuals who are treated with injustice. 
                <br/>The societies and communities should be taught and trained to respect and treat other women well as our family members. Any atrocities cannot be tolerated. We should work for their legal rights. To spread the message of respect and love and bring a change in the mentality of the world in the matter of Women empowerment and child Welfare, join us!
